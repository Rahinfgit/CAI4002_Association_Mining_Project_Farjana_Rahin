1. Introduction
This project implements supermarket data mining using Apriori and Eclat to discover frequent itemsets and association rules. It simulates a real-world analytics workflow from data cleaning to recommendation.
2. System Architecture
The system performs data loading, cleaning, frequent itemset mining, rule generation, and interactive recommendation queries.
3. Data Preprocessing
Handles empty/single-item transactions, duplicates, invalid items, whitespace, and case inconsistencies.
4. Algorithms
Apriori: Level-wise search, Apriori pruning. Eclat: Vertical TID-sets, DFS with intersections. Rules: Confidence-based filtering.
5. Results
Apriori and Eclat were both successful. Eclat ran faster due to more efficient intersections.
6. Recommendations Interface
The interactive console allows testing associations by product name.
7. Testing
Verified cleaning, duplicate handling, invalid item removal, and rule-based recommendations.
8. Limitations
No GUI, memory-based approach, CLOSET not included.
9. AI Tool Usage
ChatGPT was used to structure documentation, clarify algorithms, and generate boilerplate code.
